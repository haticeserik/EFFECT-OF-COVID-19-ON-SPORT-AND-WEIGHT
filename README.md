# EFFECT-OF-COVID-19-ON-SPORT-AND-WEIGHT
In the last year, we can say that our lives have changed from start to finish due to Covid-19, everyone has been affected in this process. Some of them are good, but most of them are bad. For example, before Covid-19, I was a person with sports at the center of his life. I'd go for a walk every morning and evening, go to the gym 4 days a week, but it's impossible to do it now. I had a serious novelization and gained weight due to Covid-19. When I look around, I see that most of my friends have the same problem. Being at home all the time,not moving, unfortunately, is a threat to all of us. in addition, we eat constantly, most of us mix boredom with hunger, or those who are bored at home want to try new dishes, as a result of which we gain weight. In short, we can't end up counting the effects of Covid-19 on our lives, I have addressed the weight problem from these problems, which are very different for everyone. Hopefully soon Covid-19 will be out of our lives and back to the good old days.
